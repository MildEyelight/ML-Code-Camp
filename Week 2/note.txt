1. DGL model
DGL model is a python package used for analysis the graph data and construct the GNN structure.
I acquired the basic knowlegde of graph and machine learning on graph through the course CS224w of Stanford.

1.1 Graph stored in DGL
DGL uses the container(torch.Tensor) to store graph data of 

2.GNN/GCN model
GCN is a main variant of GNN and is used for basic structure of neural network in this mission of node classification.
DGL package use
