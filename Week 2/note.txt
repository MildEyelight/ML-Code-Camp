This file is used to recode the process complementing the Tutorial of DGL with the node classification mission.

1. DGL 
DGL model is a python package used for analysis the graph data and construct the GNN structure.
I acquired the basic knowlegde of graph and machine learning on graph through the course CS224w of Stanford.

1.1 Graph stored in DGL
DGL uses the container(torch.Tensor) to store graph data of the information containing{node,edge,label of node,
label of edge,mask of training node,mask of test node,etc.}

1.2 dgl.nn.GraphConv()
Graph Convoluntional Layer in DGL.

2.GNN/GCN model
GCN is a main variant of GNN and is used as basic structure of neural network in this mission of node classification.
In tutorial, the common structure of GNN is adopted by author to help us understand GNN and by more to build our own
specific GNNs.

3.Node classification(/Week2/GCN for Node Classification.py)
According to the tutorial of DGL, we are going to implement a semi-supervised node classification mission.
