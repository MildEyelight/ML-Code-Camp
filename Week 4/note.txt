note for week 4 mission
Mission:
Rewrite the stochastic sampling with GNN using instead of neiborhood sampling but full map sampling
full map sampling gives a more flexible way to aggregate the information through the whole graph but
in experiment(see the python file) shows a bad result. I think just use this single technique but gives
up the homogenous of GNN is not a very good way to take.

self-check
(1)Difference among block,frontier and graph
graph means the initial dataset and we derive frontier by passing some node and all the edges between them to get a subgraph,
and then generate a block by this frontier.

(2)The first parameter of conv and the first fanout is used for which rank of the neibors?
The first parameter means the highest rank of the center node and the same as the first fanout.

(3)original NID of a sampling node.
call the function : src_nodes=block.srcdata[dgl.NID]
